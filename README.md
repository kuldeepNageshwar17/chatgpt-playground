# chatgpt-playground

Its a react application and node js server created for playing with open ai models provide by openai to use in api request parameters and generate response like [chatgpt](https://chat.openai.com/chat)

You can select all the models available in openai from dropdown and get the result coming from every model and compare the effectiveness.
